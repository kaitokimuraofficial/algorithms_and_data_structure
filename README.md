# Algorithms and Data structure

## Why this repository?
This repository stores programs related to algorithms and data structures.

This repository has separate directories for each programming language. The reason for this is that it is important to be able to implement algorithms and data structures in any programming language.

Also, when implementing algorithms and data structures, we were conscious of learning the grammatical matters of that programming language and how to write in accordance with best practices.

LeetCode is a standard preparation for technical interviews at foreign tech companies, and I also keep my notes and answers to solving LeetCode in this repository.
